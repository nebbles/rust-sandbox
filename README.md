This repository is a sandbox for trialling out rust on small projects and tutorials.

The single best documentation for learning and understanding is actually the official book. Published at https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

Its a markdown book built with mdbook (also a Rust program).

Current code is based of a tutorial for Rust in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw) by Traversy Media.

To run the package

```bash
$ cargo run
```

Rust documentation can be brought up from the command line with

```bash
$ rustup doc
```
